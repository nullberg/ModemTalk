In Android phones that have a MediaTek [SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip), it is more straight-forward to talk to the modem, i.e. the [IP block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core) responsible for telecommunications (LTE, 4G, 5G, etc.).

This app helps you to do so.
